                                  dataSourceRef specifies the object from which to populate the volume with data, if a non-empty
                                  volume is desired. This may be any object from a non-empty API group (non
                                  core object) or a PersistentVolumeClaim object.
                                  When this field is specified, volume binding will only succeed if the type of
                                  the specified object matches some installed volume populator or dynamic
                                  provisioner.
                                  This field will replace the functionality of the dataSource field and as such
                                  if both fields are non-empty, they must have the same value. For backwards
                                  compatibility, when namespace isn't specified in dataSourceRef,
                                  both fields (dataSource and dataSourceRef) will be set to the same
                                  value automatically if one of them is empty and the other is non-empty.
                                  When namespace is specified in dataSourceRef,
                                  dataSource isn't set to the same value and must be empty.
                                  There are three important differences between dataSource and dataSourceRef:
                                  * While dataSource only allows two specific types of objects, dataSourceRef
                                    allows any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim objects.
                                  * While dataSource ignores disallowed values (dropping them), dataSourceRef
                                    preserves all values, and generates an error if a disallowed value is
                                    specified.
                                  * While dataSource only allows local objects, dataSourceRef allows objects
                                    in any namespaces.
                                  (Beta) Using this field requires the AnyVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.
                                  (Alpha) Using the namespace field of dataSourceRef requires the CrossNamespaceVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.

                            Effect indicates the taint effect to match. Empty means match all taint effects.
                            When specified, allowed values are NoSchedule, PreferNoSchedule and NoExecute.

                            Key is the taint key that the toleration applies to. Empty means match all taint keys.
                            If the key is empty, operator must be Exists; this combination means to match all values and all keys.

                            Valid operators are Exists and Equal. Defaults to Equal.
                            Exists is equivalent to wildcard for value, so that a pod can
                            tolerate all taints of a particular category.

                            TolerationSeconds represents the period of time the toleration (which must be
                            of effect NoExecute, otherwise this field is ignored) tolerates the taint. By default,
                            it is not set, which means tolerate the taint forever (do not evict). Zero and
                            negative values will be treated as 0 (evict immediately) by the system.

                      If referring to a piece of an object instead of an entire object, this string
                      should contain a valid JSON/Go field access statement, such as desiredState.manifest.containers[2].
                      For example, if the object reference is to a container within a pod, this would take on a value like:
                      "spec.containers{name}" (where "name" refers to the name of the container that triggered
                      the event) or if no container name is specified "spec.containers[2]" (container with
                      index 2 in this pod). This syntax is chosen only to have some well-defined way of
                      referencing a part of an object.
