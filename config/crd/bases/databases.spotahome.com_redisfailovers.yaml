                                  There are three important differences between dataSource
                                  and dataSourceRef: * While dataSource only allows
                                  two specific types of objects, dataSourceRef allows
                                  any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim
                                  objects. * While dataSource ignores disallowed values
                                  (dropping them), dataSourceRef preserves all values,
                                  and generates an error if a disallowed value is
                                  specified. * While dataSource only allows local
                                  objects, dataSourceRef allows objects in any namespaces.
