                                of balancing the service traffic between nodes, and so each node will deliver
                                traffic only to the node-local endpoints of the service, without masquerading
                                the client source IP. (Traffic mistakenly sent to a node with no endpoints will
                                be dropped.) The default value, "Cluster", uses the standard behavior of

                                within the cluster will always get "Cluster" semantics, but clients sending to
                                a NodePort from within the cluster may need to take traffic policy into account

                                but should apply for any default implementation. If set, it is assumed that a load balancer
                                implementation is watching for Services with a matching class. Any default load balancer
                                implementation (e.g. cloud providers) should ignore Services that set this field.
                                This field can only be set when creating or updating a Service to type 'LoadBalancer'.
                                Once set, it can not be changed. This field will be wiped when a service is updated to a non 'LoadBalancer' type.

                                This feature depends on whether the underlying cloud-provider supports specifying

                                The primary use case for setting this field is for a StatefulSet's Headless Service to

                                The Kubernetes controllers that generate Endpoints and EndpointSlice resources for
                                Services interpret this to mean that all endpoints are considered "ready" even if the
                                Pods themselves are not. Agents which consume only Kubernetes generated endpoints
                                through the Endpoints or EndpointSlice resources can safely assume this behavior.

                                "ClusterIP" allocates a cluster-internal IP address for load-balancing
                                to endpoints. Endpoints are determined by the selector or if that is not
                                specified, by manual construction of an Endpoints object or
                                EndpointSlice objects. If clusterIP is "None", no virtual IP is
                                allocated and the endpoints are published as a set of endpoints rather
                                than a virtual IP.
                                "NodePort" builds on ClusterIP and allocates a port on every node which
                                routes to the same endpoints as the clusterIP.
                                "LoadBalancer" builds on NodePort and creates an external load-balancer
                                (if supported in the current cloud) which routes to the same endpoints
                                as the clusterIP.
                                "ExternalName" aliases this service to the specified externalName.
                                Several other fields do not apply to ExternalName services.
